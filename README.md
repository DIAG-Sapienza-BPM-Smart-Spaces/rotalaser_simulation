# CardBoardSim
Unity's HDRP to analyze cardboard's shadows

Right now it's possible to:
-dim lights
-move led stripes
-rotate led stripes
-move camera around
-turn on/off lights

There are some camera position presets, position but they're not well-positioned.

#BUG weird issue

Once in a while, lights decide to stop work and the only way-around (a part from increase their intensity to 10M+ lumen) is create another scene and import the whole led & cardboard package.
