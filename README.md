# CardBoardSim
Unity's HDRP to analyze cardboard's shadows



# MODEL SCALE
***For this simulation, I assumed: 1 unit = 1 cm.***  


# Instructions
  
-download everything in a folder
-open Unity Hub>Open>[that folder]  
-(optional)open Assets>test.unity  

This should open the scene named "test", another similar available scene is "indoorScene.unity", but on my device lights don't work anymore.  
First opening might require some additional time to generate lights and cache files.

Done using Unity's version 2022.3.5f1
